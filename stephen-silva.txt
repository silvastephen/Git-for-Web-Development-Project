Stretch Review questions: 
    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block 
    element?
    
    Answer: A block element starts on a new line, takes full available
    width. Inline elements do not start a new line, and only take as
    much width as possible.
    
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
   
    Answer: Absolute positioning causes other elements to not 
    react to them. It makes the element static, taking it out 
    of the flow.
    
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space
     it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
     
     Answer: Make it an inline element.
    
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements

    Elements - a and var. 1 Inline-Block by Default - button.
